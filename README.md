The Red Team Cookbook blog (RTCBb) represnts my own ongoing efforts to understand how malicious actors do bad things, and other hacky research projects.

If you told a science fiction authors in the 1960s that half a century later humankind will have willingly submitted themselves to constant audio and video surveillance, they probably would have told you that we live in a dystopic & totalitarian future. Globally, it's common practice to have a smart phone attached to our person at all times. These conditions, along with the ongoing growth of the internet has given rise to a new kind of adversary. An adversary whose goals are solely malicious, whose impact can be global, and whose actions are covert. One could be watching you through the camera in your device right now. These adversaries have new kinds of weapons like Botnets, comprised of 10's of millions of devices, which they use to attack the public, industries, utilities, and goverments, often without any accountability for the criminals who perpetrated the crime. 

We live in a new era of cybercrime. Adversaries are perpetrating financial crimes on a scale greater than any other criminals in history. Defenders need to be trained in the same manner as the criminals if they intend on preventing them from doing damage when, not if, they get into their networks.

The RTCBb is my attempt to share my research projects. To programatically emulate the methods and techniques that advanced persistent threats (APTs) use at every stage of an attack, and other hacky projects that I cook up.
